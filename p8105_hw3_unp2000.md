```

1384617 1384617 rows 15 15 columns

How many aisles are there and which aisles are the most items ordered
from? There are 134 distinct aisles.

39123

``` r
instacart_new=instacart %>%
    janitor::clean_names() %>%
    group_by(aisle_id, aisle) %>%
    summarize (n = n()) %>%
    arrange(desc(n))
```

The aisles that the most items are ordered from are fresh vegetables
(aisle 83, n = 150,609), fresh fruits (aisle 24, n = 150,473), and
packaged vegetable and fruits (aisle 123, n = 78,493).

Make a plot that shows the number of items ordered in each aisle,
limiting this to aisles with more than 10000 items ordered. Arrange
aisles sensibly, and organize your plot so others can read it.

``` r
plot_1= filter(instacart_new, n > 10000)
ggplot(
  plot_1, 
  aes(x = reorder(aisle, -n), y = n)) + 
  geom_point(color = 'red') +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1),
        axis.text = element_text(size = 7.5)) +
  labs(
    title = "Items ordered in each aisle",
    x = "Aisle",
    y = "No. of products"
  )
```

Make a table showing the three most popular items in each of the aisles
“baking ingredients”, “dog food care”, and “packaged vegetables
fruits”. Include the number of times each item is ordered in your
table.

``` r
library(knitr)
insta_rank_new = instacart %>%
      janitor::clean_names() %>%
      filter(aisle == "baking ingredients"| aisle == "dog food care"| aisle == 
      "packaged vegetables fruits") %>%
      group_by(aisle, product_name) %>%
      summarise(n = n()) %>%
      mutate(product_ranking = min_rank(desc(n))) %>% 
      filter(product_ranking < 4)  %>%
      knitr::kable ()
```

Make a table showing the mean hour of the day at which Pink Lady Apples
and Coffee Ice Cream are ordered on each day of the week; format this
table for human readers (i.e. produce a 2 x 7 table).

``` r
instacart_table2=instacart %>%
  filter(product_name == "Pink Lady Apples" | 
    product_name == "Coffee Ice Cream") %>%
    group_by(product_name, order_dow) %>%
    summarize(mean_order_hour= mean(order_hour_of_day)) %>%
    select(product_name, order_dow, mean_order_hour) %>%
    pivot_wider(
      names_from = order_dow,
        values_from = mean_order_hour) %>%
    knitr::kable ()
```

# Problem 2

First, do some data cleaning:

format the data to use appropriate variable names; focus on the “Overall
Health” topic include only responses from “Excellent” to “Poor” organize
responses as a factor taking levels ordered from “Poor” to “Excellent”

``` r
library(p8105.datasets)
data("brfss_smart2010")
```

``` r
brfss_new=brfss_smart2010 %>%
    janitor::clean_names() %>%
    filter(topic == "Overall Health"|
           response == "Excellent"|
           response == "Very good"|
           response == "Good" |
           response == "Fair"|
           response == "Poor") %>%
   mutate(response = 
            factor(response, labels = c("Poor", "Fair", "Good", "Very good", "Excellent")))%>%
            select(-location_id, -data_value_footnote_symbol, - data_value_footnote)
```

In 2002, which states were observed at 7 or more locations? What about
in 2010?

``` r
brfss_new %>%
  filter(year == "2002") %>%
  group_by(locationabbr) %>%
  summarize(
    number_locations = n_distinct(geo_location)) %>%
    filter(number_locations>6) %>%
    arrange(desc(number_locations))
```

    ## # A tibble: 6 x 2
    ##   locationabbr number_locations
    ##   <chr>                   <int>
    ## 1 PA                         10
    ## 2 MA                          8
    ## 3 NJ                          8
    ## 4 CT                          7
    ## 5 FL                          7
    ## 6 NC                          7

In 2002, the states that were observed at 7 or more locations were NC,
FL, CT, NJ, MA, PA.

In 2010, the states that were observed at 7 or more locations were SC,
PA, CO, OH, NY, MA, WA, NE, NC, MD, CA, TX, NJ, FL

``` r
brfss_new %>%
  filter(year == "2010") %>%
  group_by(locationabbr) %>%
  summarize(
    number_locations = n_distinct(geo_location)) %>%
    filter(number_locations>6) %>%
    arrange(desc(number_locations))
```

    ## # A tibble: 14 x 2
    ##    locationabbr number_locations
    ##    <chr>                   <int>
    ##  1 FL                         41
    ##  2 NJ                         19
    ##  3 TX                         16
    ##  4 CA                         12
    ##  5 MD                         12
    ##  6 NC                         12
    ##  7 NE                         10
    ##  8 WA                         10
    ##  9 MA                          9
    ## 10 NY                          9
    ## 11 OH                          8
    ## 12 CO                          7
    ## 13 PA                          7
    ## 14 SC                          7

In 2010, the states that were observed at 7 or more locations were SC,
PA, CO, OH, NY, MA, WA, NE, NC, MD, CA, TX, NJ, FL

Construct a dataset that is limited to Excellent responses, and
contains, year, state, and a variable that averages the data\_value
across locations within a state. Make a “spaghetti” plot of this average
value over time within a state (that is, make a plot showing a line for
each state across years – the geom\_line geometry and group aesthetic
will help).

``` r
excellent_data = brfss_new %>%
  filter(response == "Excellent") %>%
  group_by(year, locationabbr, response) %>%
  summarise(mean_data = mean(data_value, na.rm = TRUE)) 

brfss_spaghetti =
  excellent_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = mean_data, group = locationabbr)) +
  geom_line(aes(color = locationabbr)) +
  labs(
    title = "Average value over time within 50 states",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Average Data Value"
  )
```

Make a two-panel plot showing, for the years 2006, and 2010,
distribution of data\_value for responses (“Poor” to “Excellent”) among
locations in NY State.

``` r
two_panel = brfss_new %>%
  filter(topic == "Overall Health"|
           response == "Excellent"|
           response == "Very good"|
           response == "Good" |
           response == "Fair"|
           response == "Poor",
           year == "2006"|
           year == "2010",
           locationabbr == "NY") 
ggplot(two_panel, aes(x = response, y = data_value, color = year)) + 
  geom_point() +
  facet_grid(. ~year) +
  labs(
    title = "Distribution of Data Values for Responses among locations in NY State",
    x = "Response Type",
    y = "Data Value"
  )
```
